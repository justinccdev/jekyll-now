I'm Justin Clark-Casey, a research software architect at the University of Cambridge in the UK.  I work on 
[InterMine](http://intermine.org), a life sciences data integration platform and various side projects such as 
[Buzzbang](http://buzzbang.science), an open-source and (as yet) extremely, extremely alpha prototype search engine for 
life sciences data.

I'm very interested in:

* Knowledge graphs (as used by Google, Microsoft, Wikipedia, etc.) as used in science and 
elsewhere.
* Open Linked Data, RDF, SPARQL, ontologies and other aspects of knowledge bases.
* Data integration in the life sciences.
* AI and machine learning, especially over knowledge graphs and linked data.
* Increased digitization of science, particularly the life sciences. This encompasses initiatives such as 
  * Making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuseable)
  * Standardized workflow languages that can capture the scientific process and improve reproducibility of scientific 
  results
  * Increasing use of cloud infrastructure to accelerate and democratize scientific research.
  
Please don't hesitate to hit up my Twitter or e-mail if you want to chat or collaborate on any of these topics.

I'm also active in: 

* [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/), a distributed infrastructure for life-science information with resources
across Europe.  Here, I'm the [ELIXIR UK node technical co-ordinator](http://www.elixiruknode.org/key-roles/), 
helping the 15 member organizations of ELIXIR UK (including Imperial College and the universities of Cambridge, Oxford
and Manchester) to co-ordinate their technical strategy for interoperability, data and computation across the 
bioinformatics infrastructure.

* [Bioschemas](http://bioschemas.org), an initiative to embed [schema.org](https://schema.org) markup (as sponsored by
search engines such as Google and Microsoft) in webpages and to use it to make it easier to find life sciences data in 
the long tail of databases.

Again, please don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like to talk about those organizations.

Finally, in a previous life I was heavily involved with virtual-worlds, being a core developer, [conference co-chair](http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/staff/), 
consultant and release manager for [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org), an open-source Second Life compatible Internet-scale distributed virtual
worlds implementation. This was developed by tremendous group of volunteers, along with involvement from startups, 
universities and large companies such as IBM and Intel. [I don't work in this area anymore](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2015/08/opensim-community-loses-admired-leader/)
but if you have questions about history or maybe just want to reminisce then please tweet me :).
